# ADF Tutorial, Part 2: Creating The UI

The UI shall consist of a dialog for showing and finding employees based on: Jobs, Departments and free text search. 
The left pane should be an accordion with several tabs one for each type.
The center pane should be a filterable list which shall display a photo for each employee.
Finally a status pane on the right shall show contact details for selected employee.
The table shall have a toolbar to allow us to edit and create new users.

## 1. Creating the page.

Start by creating the base page for locating employees.

Keyword   | Value
----------|----------------------
Page type | Facelets
Page name | employees.jsf
Template  | Oracle Three column

Next add the accordion to the left and add three panes to it:

1. Departments
2. Jobs
3. Search

## 2. Add a "ADF Tree" based on the DepartmentsView object.

Fields    | DepartmentName, FirstName, LastName

Show DepartmentName and FirstName + LastName attributes in the tree.

### Hint
 
* Data Controls are found in a separate tab in the Application view.
* Dont forget to add a second node to the TreeBinding (+)

## 3. Add a "ADF Tree" based on the AllJobsView object.

Keyword   | Value
----------|------------------------------------
Fields    | JobTitle, FirstName, LastName

Show JobTitle and FirstName + LastName attributes in the tree.

## 4. Add a "ADF Table" based on the EmployeesView object.

Key       | Value

Fields    | Gravatar, FirstName, LastName, Email
Selection | Single row
Filtered  | Checked
Sortable  | Checked

Show only Gravatar, FirstName, LastName and Email.
Make sure we can select only single rows in the table.
